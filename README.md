# iTunes API Lab #
Using the iTunes API, create a search form that the user can enter a search term and display the results on the page. (HINT: make sure your query has a limit param to avoid CORS issues). This can be just a simple HTML/JS approach similar to the in-class books demo. The results should be styled and organized in a clean format.
